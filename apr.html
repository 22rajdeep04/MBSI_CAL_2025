                Hansenula polymorpha occurs naturally in spoiled orange juice,maize meal, the gut of various insects and
                soil. Hansenula polymorpha(also designated as P. angusta, Ogataea angusta) is the widest known member of
                the Hansenula genus. Hansenula polymorpha is an important yeast species in industrial biotechnology and
                has become a powerful production platform for heterologous protein biosynthesis.


                <br>

                <h4>Genetics</h4> <br>
                Hansenula polymorpha is thermotolerant and capable of growing at temperatures ranging from 30 to 50o C.
                Hansenula polymorpha is a methylotrophic yeast, it can utilise methanol as its sole carbon and energy
                source.The H. polymorpha RB11 genome consists of approximately 9.5 Mb and is organised as six
                chromosomes
                ranging in size from 0.9 to 2.2 Mb.
                <br>

                <h4>industrial Applications</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Production of heterologous proteins</b>
                        One of the most significant applications of H. polymorpha is its use as a host for the
                        production of heterologous proteins.One of the most notable successes is the production of
                        hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), which is used in vaccines. This vaccine contains the small
                        surface antigen of HBV (subtype adr) that is synthesised and purified from genetically
                        engineered H. polymorpha yeast cells. Each 1 ml of the vaccine contains 1 mg of purified
                        hepatitis B
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Biofuel Production</b>
                        Bioethanol is the term used for ethanol produced from biomass for biofuel applications. Its
                        combustion efficiency is 15% higher than that of gasoline due to the presence of 34.7% oxygen.
                        Research studies on H. polymorpha strains have demonstrated its ability to ferment
                        lignocellulose sugars at high temperatures for ethanol production. The capability of
                        thermotolerant H. polymorpha yeast to produce ethanol from the glucose, fructose, and xylose
                        could be used for the high temperature (40–45 °C) fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates
                        (rich in aforementioned sugar) for ethanol production. The high-temperature fermentation using
                        H. polymorpha yeast could also be beneficial from a technical and environmental point of view.
                        This type of fermentation reduces the risk of contamination by other microorganisms that cannot
                        survive at elevated temperatures, which ultimately improves the process’ efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Recombinant Protein Production</b>
                        The first heterologous protein produced in H. polymorpha was the surface antigens from hepatitis
                        B virus. Furthermore, H. polymorpha, has been extensively used for the production of Virus-like
                        particle (VLP), which are viral proteins that can be used for the development of
                        vaccines.Further examples of recombinant proteins using H. polymorpha as host include the human
                        Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) and Staphylokinase (SAK).

                <H4>conclusion</H4>
                <p>Hansenula polymorpha has established itself as a versatile organism in industrial biotechnology. Its
                    ability to utilise methanol, tolerate extreme environmental conditions, and produce important
                    products like heterologous proteins make it an attractive host for various applications.
