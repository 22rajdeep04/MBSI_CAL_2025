                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>In a world where microbes outnumber the higher organisms, not just in population but also in variety,
                    a tiny set of microorganisms lurk around among us. Though they dont cause us many troubles, but they
                    certainly do wreak havoc on other free living bacterial like E. coli. 1917 Felix d'Herelle realised
                    that they had the potential to kill bacteria. After a pre-antibiotic era heyday they were then
                    essentially disregarded as significant therapeutic agents in the West, primarily due to the
                    comparative ease by which antibiotics could be administered. Research and the practice of using
                    bacteriophages did continue in some countries such as Georgia (as part of the former USSR), where
                    they were, and continue to be routinely isolated and used to treat a large number of
                    diseases.Bacteriophage research then focused on a number of model phages which primarily infected E.
                    coli. The recent renaissance seen in phage biology has been triggered due to a growing awareness of
                    the number of phages in all bacterial dominated environments (as revealed by epiflourescent and
                    electron microscopy, and from molecular studies), and indeed in the genomes of bacteria following
                    whole genome sequencing projects. This checkered history has resulted in a patchy knowledge of phage
                    biology but with enough observations for scientists to realize that phages are dictating many
                    aspects of Bacterial/Archaeal biology.


                    S. platensis form massive populations in tropical and subtropical water bodies characterized by high
                    levels of carbonate and bicarbonate and high pH (up to 11). S. platensis seems to be a more widely
                    distributed species, mainly found in Africa, but also in Asia and South America.</p>
                <h4>Phage Therapy</h4>
                <p>Admonitions of a return to “the pre-antibiotic era” have become increasingly common and regulatory
                    organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and WHO have declared antibiotic
                    resistance a threat to global health. Almost a decade before the discovery of penicillin, the
                    controversial practice of phage therapy was being developed as a treatment for bacterial infections.
                    Phages, short for bacteriophages, are bacteria-specific viruses that have been used as a treatment
                    against pathogens such as Shigella dysenteriae as early as 1919. With an estimated 1031-1032 phages
                    in the world at any given time, they make up the most abundant biological entity on Earth and play a
                    crucial role in regulating bacterial populations; phages are responsible for the death of
                    approximately 20%-40% of all marine surface bacteria every 24 h. Although the idea of using
                    bacterial viruses therapeutically against bacterial infections has recently gained traction in
                    response to the emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, the practice has been around for nearly
                    a century. Since the initial observations of phage-induced bacterial lysis, the biological nature of
                    phage, as well as their therapeutic value, has been controversial. Many mistakes were made during
                    these early trials of phage therapy and most can be attributed to a poor understanding of the
                    biological nature of phages. Rudimentary purification and storage protocols resulted in low titers
                    of active phage and contamination from bacterial antigens, and phages that lacked infectivity for
                    the target bacteria were used for treatment. The increased efficacy of antibacterial agents when
                    used in conjunction implies that therapy using some combination of phage, phage-derived lytic
                    proteins, bioengineered phage, and/or antibiotics will be necessary for addressing the growing
                    problem of antibiotic-resistant infections.
