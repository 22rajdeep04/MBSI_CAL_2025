                Ever since its discovery in 1957, Corynebacterium glutamicum has become a well-established industrial
                strain and is known for its massive capability of producing various amino acids (like L-lysine and
                L-glutamate) and other value-added chemicals. C. glutamicum has also been metabolically engineered and
                used in the degradation/assimilation of highly toxic and ubiquitous environmental contaminants, arsenic,
                present in water or soil.
                <br>

                <h4>Basic Information about C. glutamicum</h4> <br>
                years ago by Dr. Kinoshita and was identified as a natural producer of glutamate (Becker and Wittmann, 2012; Kinoshita et al., 1958).. It is characterised as soil-borne, fast-growing, non-capsulated, rod-shaped, biotin auxotroph, non-motile, and catalase-positive bacteria with high G + C content. C. glutamicum is a facultative anaerobe capable of utilising a wide range of carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, acetate, and ethanol.
                <br>

                <h4>Genetics</h4> <br>
                <br>
                <p>The complete genomic sequence of Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032, well-known in industry for the production of amino acids, e.g. of L-glutamate and L-lysine was determined. The C. glutamicum genome was found to consist of a single circular chromosome comprising 3,282,708 base pairs. 3002 protein-coding genes have been identified.

                </p>
                <h4>Industrial and Biotechnological Applications</h4>
                <p> Applications of C. glutamicum range from classical feed and food to cosmetics, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. It is also an excellent host for the production of heterologous proteins like amylases, proteases, nucleases and xylanases. Recent studies have also suggested another probable use for C. glutamicum in the field of environmental degradation/assimilation of highly toxic heavy metals like arsenic, from contaminated water or soil.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Amino Acid Production:-</b> Corynebacterium glutamicum is used for the million-ton-scale production of food and feed amino acids such as L-glutamate and L-lysine and has been engineered for production of carotenoids such as L-glutamic acid is one of the major amino acids that is present in a wide variety of foods. It is mainly used as a food additive and flavour enhancer in the form of sodium salt. Corynebacterium glutamicum (C. glutamicum) is one of the major organisms widely used for glutamic acid production. </li>
                    <li><b>Bioremediation of Arsenic:-</b> Arsenic is an extremely toxic metalloid that, when present in high concentrations, severely threatens the biota and human health.Corynebacterium glutamicum, which is used for the industrial production of amino acids and nucleotides, is one of the most arsenic-resistant microorganisms described to date. Analysis of the C. glutamicum genome revealed the presence of two complete ars operons (ars1 and ars2) comprising the typical three-gene structure arsRBC, with an extra arsC1 located downstream from arsC1 (ars1 operon), and two orphan genes (arsB3 and arsC4). The involvement of both ars operons in arsenic resistance in C. glutamicum was confirmed by disruption and amplification of those genes. The strains obtained were resistant to up to 60 mM arsenite, one of the highest levels of bacterial resistance to arsenite so far described.  </li>
                    <li><b>Bioplastics Production:-</b> In recent years, C. glutamicum has emerged as a promising platform for the biosynthesis of bioplastics and other bio-based chemicals. For instance, it has been engineered to produce polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), which are biodegradable polymers used in the production of bioplastics. A biosynthetic pathway for poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) [P(3HB)] production by Corynebacterium glutamicum was developed by introducing the phbCAB operon derived from Ralstonia eutropha.Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) synthase activity was detected in this recombinant C. glutamicum.</li>

                </p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    Corynebacterium glutamicum has proven itself as an indispensable microorganism in the field of industrial biotechnology. Its natural ability to produce amino acids, coupled with advancements in genetic and metabolic engineering, has broadened its industrial applications.
