                Under the aegis of the departmental society, ‘Sukshmjeev’ and Star College Scheme, various
                academic and co-curricular activities in the form of annual departmental fest, conferences, seminars
                and symposia etc. are organized through which students augment their knowledge in all aspects of
                microbiology and related fields. This initiative provides a platform for interaction amongst students,
                faculty members and various academicians/industrialists invited from time to time from renowned
                institutions/industries across the country and from abroad as well. This year a seminar on
                “Advancements in Molecular Microbiology in the Revolutionary ‘Omics’ Era” was organized as a
                part of the annual festival of the Department, Micro Quest. Dr. Syed Shams Yazdani and Dr. Vikram
                Saini, from ICGEB and AIIMS respectively, delivered lectures in this seminar. Dr. Saurabh Saran
                from CSIR-IIIM, Jammu and Dr. Qasim Beg from Boston University, USA visited the department
                and interacted with students to discuss higher education opportunities and career options after
                graduation
                Our inter-college microbiology fest “Microquest” is organized every year and attracts several
                participants from other colleges and universities. In this festival, various co-curricular competitive
                events are organized like collage making, poster competition, streak art, quizzes, treasure hunt etc.
                Students of the department are also encouraged to participate in sports and extra-curricular events
                organized in the college from time to time. We release our departmental magazine “Life Under Lens”
                every year which includes various scientific articles, doodles, memes, poems etc. compiled by our
                students and faculty.
