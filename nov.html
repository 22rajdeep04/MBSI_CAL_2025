                <h4>Habitat</h4>
                <p>Spirulina platensis, is a photosynthetic, filamentous, spiral-shaped, multicellular and blue- green
                    micro alga. As it contains chlorophyll a, like higher plants, botanists classify it as a micro alga
                    belonging to Cyanophyceae class; but according to bacteriologists it is a bacterium due to its
                    prokaryotic structure. Mexicans (Aztecs) started using this microorganism as human food. Its
                    chemical
                    composition includes proteins (55%-70%), carbohydrates (15%-25%), essential fatty acids (18%),
                    vitamins,
                    minerals and pigments like carotenes, chlorophyll a and phycocyanin.

                    S. platensis form massive populations in tropical and subtropical water bodies characterized by high
                    levels of carbonate and bicarbonate and high pH (up to 11). S. platensis seems to be a more widely
                    distributed species, mainly found in Africa, but also in Asia and South America.</p>
                <h4>Morphology</h4>
                <p>Spirulina belongs to the oxygenic photosynthetic bacteria that cover the groups Cyanobacteria They
                    are filamentous and non-heterocystous. They are prokaryotic, has pluri-stratified cell wall,
                    photosynthetic or thylakoid lamella system, ribosomes and fibrils of DNA region and numerous
                    inclusions are present. The capsule has fibrillar structure and covers each filament protecting
                    it. The helical shape of Spirulina in liquid culture is changed to spiral shape in solid media.
                    These changes are due to hydratation or dehydratation of oligopeptides in the peptidoglycan layer
                    which are caused by environmental factors, mainly temperature ,physical and chemical conditions.
                    Cell division occurs by binary fission
                </p>
                <h4>Economic Importance</h4>
                <p>Spirulina platensis is used as a potential health food in human diet and used in food industry as a source of ingredients especially with high minerals. S.platensis are known to contain an excellent source of minerals, especially calcium and potassium. Spirulina is claimed as a non-toxic, nutritious food, with some corrective properties against viral attacks and tumoral growth and as a source of the yellow coloration of egg yolk when consumed by hens. By taking Spirulina, people are able to maintain consistent energy levels. In addition, because it is so high in minerals, protein and essential fatty acids it is a healthy energy food that is especially useful for people on low-calorie diets. It lowers cholesterol, suppresses fatty accumulation in the liver, prevents tumor formation, enhances the immune system and protects kidneys. Thus in Indian system of medicine, the blue green algae S.platensis is considered as an important source of food and as health tonic.
