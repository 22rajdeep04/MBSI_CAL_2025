                Pichia pastoris is a species of methylotrophic yeast, used for protein production using recombinant DNA
                techniques. Hence it is used in biochemical and genetic research in academia and the biotechnical
                industry.
                <br>

                <h4>Pichia pastoris as an expression system</h4> <br>
                Pichia pastoris is frequently used as an expression system for the production of proteins. A number of
                properties makes P. pastoris suited for this task: P. pastoris has a high growth rate and is able to
                grow on a simple, inexpensive medium. P. pastoris can grow in either shake flasks or a fermenter, which
                makes it suitable for both small and large scale production

                Pichia pastoris has two alcohol oxidase genes, Aox1 and Aox2, which have a strongly inducible promoter.
                These genes allow Pichia to use methanol as a carbon and energy source. The AOX promoters are induced by
                methanol and are repressed by e.g. glucose. Usually the gene for the desired protein is introduced under
                the control of the AOX1 promoter, which means that protein production can be induced by the addition of
                methanol. In a popular expression vector, the desired protein is produced as a fusion product to the
                secretion signal of the α-mating factor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast). This causes the
                protein to be secreted into the growth medium, which greatly facilitates subsequent protein
                purification. There are commercially available plasmids that have these features incorporated (such as
                the pPICZα vector).

                <h4>Biotherapeutic production</h4> <br>
                <br>

                <p>Pichia pastoris was used for the production of over 500 biotherapeutics like interferon
                    gamma.However, one drawback of this protein expression system is the over-glycosylation with high
                    mannose structure which potentially is the cause of immunogenicity
                </p>
                <h4>Advantages of using <i>Pichia pastoris</i> over <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i></h4>
                <p>Firstly, Pichia, as mentioned above, is a methylotroph, meaning it can grow with the simple alcohol
                    methanol as its only source of energy — Pichia can easily be grown in cell suspension in reasonably
                    strong methanol solutions that would kill most other micro-organisms, a system that is cheap to set
                    up and maintain.
                    Secondly, Pichia can grow to very high cell densities, and under ideal conditions can multiply to
                    the point where the cell suspension is practically a paste. As the protein yield from expression in
                    a microbe is roughly equal to the product of the protein produced per cell and the number of cells,
                    this makes Pichia of great use when trying to produce large quantities of protein without expensive
                    equipment.</p>
                <h4><i>Pichia pastoris</i> as a model organism</h4>
                <p>
                    Another advantage of Pichia pastoris is its similarity to the well-studied Saccharomyces cerevisiae
                    (also known as baker's yeast). As a model organism for biology, and having been used by man for
                    various purposes throughout history, S. cerevisiae is well studied, to say the least. The two yeast
                    species (Pichia, Saccharomyces) have similar growth conditions and tolerances, and thus the
                    culturing of Pichia pastoris can be readily adopted by labs without specialist equipment.
