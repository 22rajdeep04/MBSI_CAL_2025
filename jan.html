                Mycoremediation is a branch of bioremediation that uses fungi to degrade environmental pollutants. Under
                this process, the natural metabolic processes of fungi and mainly the enzymes are used to break down a
                wide
                range of contaminants such as hydrocarbons, pesticides, heavy metals and complex organic compounds.
                Mycoremediation is a method that utilises fungi mycelium in contaminated soil sites as a remedial
                treatment.
                <br>

                <h4>Why Fungi? </h4> <br>
                Fungi have a better edge and are uniquely suited for the complex process of mycoremediation due to their
                ability to produce a vast range of extracellular enzymes that can break down complex organic molecules
                into
                simpler, less harmful substances. Unlike bacteria, which are limited to degrading pollutants in aqueous
                environments, fungi can colonise and penetrate solid substrates, such as soil, wood, and organic matter.
                This ability is particularly important in the degradation of pollutants like polycyclic aromatic
                hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and dioxins, which are often tightly bound to
                solid
                matrices and are resistant to bacterial degradation. <br>

                <h4>Phanerochaete chrysosporium- The main strain for Mycoremediation</h4> <br>
                Among the fungi used in mycoremediation, Phanerochaete chrysosporium—a white-rot fungus—stands out for
                its
                remarkable ability to degrade some of the most toxic pollutants in the environment.
                Phanerochaete chrysosporium is one of the most studied fungi in the field of mycoremediation. As it is a
                white-rot fungus, it can degrade lignin, a complex polymer found in wood. The same enzymatic machinery
                that
                breaks down lignin also enables P. chrysosporium to degrade a wide range of environmental pollutants,
                those
                that are structurally similar to lignin.
                The most significant contribution of P. chrysosporium to mycoremediation is its ability to degrade
                polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are persistent organic pollutants that pose serious
                health
                risks due to their cancer inducing properties. These hydrocarbons are found in substances like oil
                spills
                and industrial waste. <br>
                <h4>How do they degrade these complex biomolecules?</h4><br>
                P. chrysosporium secretes lignin peroxidases and manganese peroxidases.
                These enzymes oxidise the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs
                This breaks them down into smaller, less toxic compounds.

                <h4>Use of P.chrysosporium in textile industries:-</h4><br>
                Enormous volumes of effluent are generated at different
                stages of textile manufacturing, as a result of the use of large amounts of chemicals and dyes. Effluent
                derived from the textile and dye activities can provoke serious environmental impact in the water bodies
                because of the presence of toxic reactive dyes, chlorolignin residues and dark coloration The biological
                breakdown of the chlorolignin residues and the chromophoric groups responsible for the dark coloration
                of
                the textile effluent can be accomplished by the use of enzymes from the white rot fungus, Phanerochaete
                chrysosporium.
                Application in Bioaugmentation:- In addition to its role in mycoremediation, P. chrysosporium is used in
                bioaugmentation, a process where specific microorganisms are introduced to contaminated environments to
                enhance the degradation of pollutants. The fungus can be added to soils or sediments contaminated with
                complex organic pollutants, such as PAHs, to accelerate the breakdown of these substances.
                These diverse applications of Phanerochaete chrysosporium shows how this microbe is essential in the
                removal
                of toxic substances from the soil and also help in the cleaning and detoxification of effluents released
                from the textiles industry. Beyond mycoremediation, this microbe also has importance in the
                pharmaceutical,environmental contexts.
