                Xanthomonas campestris is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes bacterial black spots in tomato, pepper
                and other few cruciferous plants. It is a bacterium previously isolated from Japan in 1997. Xanthomonas
                campestris, is seen as the most critical and most harm causing bacterium which is a notable plant
                pathogen of crucifers, influencing brassicas family all over the planet. However, it is also an abundant
                source of Xanthan gum which has numerous industrial and pharmaceutical applications. Xanthomonas is one
                of the important genera of the family Pseudomonadaceae in the order Pseudomonadales. Xanthomonas belongs
                to Gammaproteobacteria and is composed of 27 species. An unambiguous identification of the pathovars of
                X. campestris can be of great use in plant pathology. The X. campestris pathovars that are defined by
                the host or disease symptoms are difficult to identify by other phenotypic characteristics. Xanthomonas
                campestris group is the largest of all and is found to cause diseases in many plant species. It is
                therefore classified into pathovars differentiated by the host reaction

                <br>

                <h4>Xanthan Gum production</h4> <br>
                Xanthan gum is a capsular heteropolysaccharide produced by the strains of X. campestris. This is often
                associated quite loosely with the cells. Its primary structure consists of repeated pentasaccharide
                units formed by two glucose units, two mannose units, and one glucuronic acid unit, in the molar ratio
                2.8:2.0:2.0, and molecular weight distribution between 2 and 20 million Da. Its main chain consists of
                b-D-glucose units linked at the one and four positions. The chemical structure of the main chain is
                identical to that of cellulose. Trisaccharide side chains contain a D-glucuronic acid unit between two
                D-mannose units linked at the O-3 position of every other glucose residue in the main chain

                <h4>Food spoilage</h4> <br>
                <br>

                <p>Xanthomonads are the cause of a number of preharvest diseases of fruits and vegetables. They cause
                    blights, spots, cankers, and rots of different fruits and vegetables (Table 3). Lima bean pods can
                    be spoiled by the common blight caused by X. campestris pv. phaseoli. Being a part of the natural
                    microflora, Xanthomonads are invariably associated with plants and plant products. The role of
                    Xanthomonads in the postharvest spoilage of plant foods and food products has been poorly
                    investigated. The association of the various hydrolytic enzymes with the growth of Xanthomonads,
                    however, suggests their high food spoilage potential. Many Xanthomonads are known to possess
                    proteolytic, amylolytic, cellulolytic, pectolytic, and lipolytic activities.
