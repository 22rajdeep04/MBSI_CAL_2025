                Escherichia coli is one of the most well studied microorganisms in the world of microbiology. It was
                discovered by Theodor Escherich in 1885. E.coli has become an important and most widely used as a model
                organism in molecular biology as well as biotechnology. It is both a common commensal inhabitant of the
                gastrointestinal tract and one of the most important pathogens in humans. This article focuses on the
                details of physiology , genetics , biofilm formation and the most important topic; Industrial
                applications of E.coli and different strains.

                <br>

                <h4>Features of <i>Escherichia coli</i> </h4> <br>
                E. coli is a facultative anaerobe that can grow in the presence or absence of oxygen. It is rod-shaped
                and motile due to the presence of flagella. E. coli is classified under the family Enterobacteriaceae.
                <br>

                <h4>Formation of Rdar Biofilm- An interesting and unique property of E.coli strains
                </h4> <br>
                <br>

                <p>Biofilm formation is the capability of the microorganisms to self-organise into multicellular
                    communities embedded in a mainly self-produced, extracellular matrix directed through distinct
                    genetic programs. Besides being the major lifestyle of most microorganisms, biofilm formation is a
                    medical problem of wide significance. Indeed, biofilm formation is considered both a major virulence
                    factor of chronic infections due to the inability of the immune system to eradicate the
                    microorganisms and a clinical problem due to the failure of antibiotics to successfully eliminate
                    them.
                </p>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>Rdar biofilm formation, a biofilm displayed by a distinct colony morphology type, was characterised
                    in commensal and uropathogenic strains of E. coli . Rdar biofilm is a multicellular biofilm
                    behaviour characterised by the expression of the extracellular matrix components curli fimbriae and
                    cellulose. The major hub of rdar biofilm regulation is the transcriptional regulator CsgD. Commensal
                    isolates and E. coli pathovars have been reported to express the rdar morphotype under laboratory
                    conditions.

                <h4>Industrial and Biotechnological significance of E.coli. ; How it has become an important microorganism for the Industry.
                </h4><br>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Biofuel Production:-</b> Organisms such as E. coli and Clostridia sp are considered because of their ability to use both pentose and hexose sugars.The native E. coli is capable of producing ethanol through an endogenous process in which under anaerobic conditions,  one mole of glucose is metabolised into two moles of formate, two moles of acetate, and one mole of ethanol. Researchers have modified E. coli to produce higher alcohols by introducing non-native metabolic pathways, which improve the yield and efficiency of biofuel production. </li>
                    
                    <li><b>Biopharmaceutical Production:-</b>Escherichia coli is the most preferred microorganism to express heterologous proteins for therapeutic use, as around 30% of the approved therapeutic proteins are currently being produced using it as a host. Owing to its rapid growth, high yield of the product, cost-effectiveness, and easy scale-up process, E. coli is an expression host of choice in the biotechnology industry for large-scale production of proteins, particularly non-glycosylated proteins, for therapeutic use. Some of the important biopharmaceuticals products produced in E.coli are:- Humulinn(rh insulin used in diabetes), IntronA(interferon É‘2b). </li>
                    
                    <li><b>Recombinant Human Growth Hormone Production:-</b>Human growth hormone (HGH), somatotropin, is a protein consisting of 191 amino acids. It is essential for linear growth and its application in the treatment of dwarfism is well established.The expression of HGH in Escherichia coli using recombinant DNA technology provides an inexhaustible source of a single eukaryotic protein. The bacterially synthesised HGH, produced from E. coli, is methionyl-HGH (Met-somatotropin), the extra methionine arising from the AUG start codon inserted at the beginning of the gene. This cloned product has now been purified to homogeneity and its biological properties examined.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4><br>
                The future of E. coli in industrial biotechnology holds great promise. Some important applications include the production of therapeutic antibodies, vaccines, and biosensors. As genetic engineering is progressing forward, the significance of E coli grows and it is now certain to play an important role in the biotechnological industries. Continued research and development can further help us to explore more about the secrets lying in the complex world of E.coli.
